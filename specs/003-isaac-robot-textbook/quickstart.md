# Quickstart: Isaac Robot Textbook Module 3

## Overview
Module 3 focuses on NVIDIA Isaac and its role in humanoid robotics, covering perception, navigation, and path planning concepts. This module is designed for students with ROS 2 knowledge, AI learners, and beginners to Isaac platforms.

## Prerequisites
- Foundational knowledge of ROS 2 and simulation (for some students)
- Basic understanding of robotics concepts
- Familiarity with Docusaurus documentation navigation

## Getting Started

### 1. Start with Module Overview
Begin by reading the module introduction to understand:
- The role of NVIDIA Isaac in robot intelligence
- How perception, navigation, and learning power humanoid robots
- The learning outcomes you'll achieve

### 2. Progress Through Chapters Sequentially
The module is structured as three progressive chapters:

**Chapter 1: Isaac Sim — Perception & Synthetic Worlds**
- [Understand the role of perception in humanoid intelligence](../docs/module-3-isaac-robot-brain/chapter-1-isaac-sim/perception.md)
- [Learn about photorealistic simulation for training AI models](../docs/module-3-isaac-robot-brain/chapter-1-isaac-sim/synthetic-worlds.md)
- [Explore synthetic data generation for vision tasks](../docs/module-3-isaac-robot-brain/chapter-1-isaac-sim/synthetic-data.md)
- [Discover domain randomization techniques](../docs/module-3-isaac-robot-brain/chapter-1-isaac-sim/domain-randomization.md)

**Chapter 2: Isaac ROS — Visual SLAM & Navigation**
- [Study Visual SLAM (VSLAM) concepts](../docs/module-3-isaac-robot-brain/chapter-2-isaac-ros/vslam-concepts.md)
- [Understand hardware-accelerated perception pipelines](../docs/module-3-isaac-robot-brain/chapter-2-isaac-ros/hardware-acceleration.md)
- [Learn about localization and mapping in complex environments](../docs/module-3-isaac-robot-brain/chapter-2-isaac-ros/localization-mapping.md)
- [Explore integration between Isaac ROS and ROS 2 systems](../docs/module-3-isaac-robot-brain/chapter-2-isaac-ros/ros-integration.md)

**Chapter 3: Nav2 — Path Planning for Humanoid Robots**
- [Understand global vs local path planning](../docs/module-3-isaac-robot-brain/chapter-3-nav2/path-planning.md)
- [Learn about obstacle avoidance and environment awareness](../docs/module-3-isaac-robot-brain/chapter-3-nav2/obstacle-avoidance.md)
- [Study navigation stacks for legged robots](../docs/module-3-isaac-robot-brain/chapter-3-nav2/navigation-stacks.md)
- [Prepare humanoids for real-world movement](../docs/module-3-isaac-robot-brain/chapter-3-nav2/humanoid-movement.md)

### 3. Complete Practical Exercises
Each chapter includes exercises that reinforce theoretical concepts. Complete these to solidify your understanding.

### 4. Verify Learning Outcomes
At the end of the module, you should be able to:
- Explain the role of NVIDIA Isaac in robot intelligence
- Describe photorealistic simulation and synthetic data generation
- Explain Visual SLAM and robot navigation concepts
- Understand path planning for bipedal humanoid movement
