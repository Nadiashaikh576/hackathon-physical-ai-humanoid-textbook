    "description": "This module introduces ROS 2 as the middleware nervous system of humanoid robots. Learners will understand how ROS 2 enables reliable communication and control across robotic components using nodes, topics, and services. The module also covers how Python-based AI agents interact with ROS controllers through rclpy, and how humanoid robot structure is defined using URDF for simulation and control readiness."
