# Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)

## Introduction

Welcome to Module 1 of your journey into humanoid robotics! This module introduces the Robot Operating System 2 (ROS 2) as the middleware nervous system of humanoid robots. Think of ROS 2 as the neural pathways that allow different parts of a robot to communicate and coordinate with each other seamlessly.

In this module, you will explore how ROS 2 serves as the foundational infrastructure that enables reliable communication and control across various robotic components. Just as our nervous system allows different organs in our body to work together harmoniously, ROS 2 allows sensors, actuators, controllers, and AI algorithms in a robot to collaborate effectively.

ROS 2 is not just a software framework—it's a comprehensive ecosystem that provides tools, libraries, and conventions that simplify the development of complex robotic applications. Through this module, you'll understand how ROS 2 enables the creation of distributed systems where multiple processes can work together to achieve sophisticated behaviors in humanoid robots.

## Glossary

- **ROS 2**: Robot Operating System 2, a flexible framework for writing robotic software providing tools, libraries, and conventions.
- **Node**: A process that performs computation in ROS; nodes are organized into a graph structure for distributed computation.
- **Topic**: A named bus over which nodes exchange messages in a publish-subscribe pattern.
- **Service**: A synchronous request/response communication pattern between nodes.
- **Action**: An asynchronous communication pattern for long-running tasks with feedback.
- **rclpy**: The Python client library for ROS 2, providing Python developers access to all ROS 2 capabilities.
