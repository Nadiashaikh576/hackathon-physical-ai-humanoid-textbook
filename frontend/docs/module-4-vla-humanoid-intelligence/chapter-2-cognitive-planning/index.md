# Chapter 2: Cognitive Planning with LLMs

**Learning Progress Indicator**: [========  ] 80% complete

This chapter explores how Large Language Models (LLMs) function as reasoning and planning engines in humanoid robotics. We'll examine how natural language goals are translated into action sequences, how tasks are decomposed, and how error handling and replanning work conceptually.

## Topics Covered

In this chapter, you will learn about:
- LLMs as reasoning and planning engines
- Translating natural language goals into action sequences
- Task decomposition and decision-making
- Error handling and replanning
- Safety and controllability at a conceptual level

## Building on Previous Knowledge

This chapter builds on the voice-to-action concepts from Chapter 1, showing how structured intents from voice commands can be processed by LLMs to generate complex action sequences.
