# Chapter 1: Voice-to-Action — Speech as Robot Input

**Learning Progress Indicator**: [====      ] 40% complete

This chapter introduces the concept of voice-to-action conversion in humanoid robotics. We'll explore why voice is a natural interface for humanoids, examine speech-to-text technologies like OpenAI Whisper, and understand how spoken commands are converted to structured intent that robots can execute.

## Topics Covered

In this chapter, you will learn about:
- Why voice is a natural interface for humanoids
- Speech-to-text using OpenAI Whisper
- From spoken commands to structured intent
- Integrating voice input with ROS 2 systems
- Limitations and latency considerations

## Why This Matters

Voice interfaces are crucial for humanoid robots because they enable natural human-robot interaction. Understanding the voice-to-action pipeline is foundational for more advanced topics like cognitive planning with LLMs.
