# Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac™)

Welcome to Module 3 of the AI-Native Book focused on Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics. This module explores how advanced AI systems act as the "brain" of humanoid robots using NVIDIA Isaac for perception, training, localization, and navigation in simulated and real environments.

## Overview

This module covers how NVIDIA Isaac technologies power humanoid robot intelligence:

- **Perception**: Using Isaac Sim for understanding the environment
- **Navigation**: Using Isaac ROS for Visual SLAM and navigation
- **Path Planning**: Using Nav2 for humanoid movement planning

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this module, you should be able to:
- Understand the role of NVIDIA Isaac in robot intelligence
- Explain photorealistic simulation and synthetic data generation
- Describe Visual SLAM and robot navigation concepts
- Understand path planning for bipedal humanoid movement

## Structure

The module is organized into three chapters:

1. [Chapter 1: Isaac Sim — Perception & Synthetic Worlds](./chapter-1-isaac-sim/index.md)
2. [Chapter 2: Isaac ROS — Visual SLAM & Navigation](./chapter-2-isaac-ros/index.md)
3. [Chapter 3: Nav2 — Path Planning for Humanoid Robots](./chapter-3-nav2/index.md)

Let's begin by exploring how Isaac Sim enables perception in humanoid intelligence.
