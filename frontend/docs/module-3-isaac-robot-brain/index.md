# Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac™)

Welcome to Module 3 of the AI-Native Book focused on Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics. This module covers how advanced AI systems act as the "brain" of humanoid robots using NVIDIA Isaac for perception, training, localization, and navigation in simulated and real environments.

## Overview

This module explores NVIDIA Isaac's role in robot intelligence, focusing on:
- Perception through Isaac Sim
- Navigation using Isaac ROS
- Path planning with Nav2

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this module, you should be able to:
- Understand the role of NVIDIA Isaac in robot intelligence
- Explain photorealistic simulation and synthetic data generation
- Describe Visual SLAM and robot navigation concepts
- Understand path planning for bipedal humanoid movement

## Prerequisites

- Foundational knowledge of ROS 2 and simulation
- Basic understanding of robotics concepts
- Familiarity with Docusaurus documentation navigation

## Structure

The module is organized into three chapters:

1. [Chapter 1: Isaac Sim — Perception & Synthetic Worlds](./chapter-1-isaac-sim/index.md)
2. [Chapter 2: Isaac ROS — Visual SLAM & Navigation](./chapter-2-isaac-ros/index.md)
3. [Chapter 3: Nav2 — Path Planning for Humanoid Robots](./chapter-3-nav2/index.md)

Let's begin with understanding how Isaac Sim enables perception in humanoid intelligence.
