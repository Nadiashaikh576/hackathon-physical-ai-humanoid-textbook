# Chapter 3: Nav2 — Path Planning for Humanoid Robots

**Learning Progress Indicator**: [========= ] 90% complete

This chapter focuses on Navigation2 (Nav2) and its application to humanoid robot navigation. Nav2 is the state-of-the-art navigation framework adapted for the unique challenges of bipedal locomotion and balance requirements.

## Topics Covered

In this chapter, you will learn about:
- Global vs local path planning strategies
- Obstacle avoidance and environment awareness
- Navigation stacks for legged robots
- Preparing humanoids for real-world movement

## Bringing It All Together

This chapter represents the practical application of perception and navigation concepts from previous chapters, showing how they culminate in actual robot movement planning.
