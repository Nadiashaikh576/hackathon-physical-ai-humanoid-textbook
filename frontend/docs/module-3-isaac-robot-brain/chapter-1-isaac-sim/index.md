# Chapter 1: Isaac Sim — Perception & Synthetic Worlds

**Learning Progress Indicator**: [=====     ] 50% complete

This chapter introduces NVIDIA Isaac Sim and its critical role in humanoid robot perception. Isaac Sim provides photorealistic simulation environments that are essential for training AI models in controlled, repeatable conditions.

## Topics Covered

In this chapter, you will learn about:
- The role of perception in humanoid intelligence
- Photorealistic simulation for training AI models
- Synthetic data generation for vision tasks
- Domain randomization and how it helps bridge the reality gap

## Why This Matters

Isaac Sim is critical for Physical AI as it allows for synthetic data generation with domain randomization to improve model generalization. This approach enables training in diverse, controlled environments where real data would be expensive or dangerous to collect.
