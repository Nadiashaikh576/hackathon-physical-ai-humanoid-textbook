# Chapter 2: Isaac ROS — Visual SLAM & Navigation

**Learning Progress Indicator**: [========= ] 75% complete

This chapter explores Isaac ROS and its role in Visual SLAM (VSLAM) and navigation. Isaac ROS provides hardware-accelerated perception and navigation capabilities by leveraging NVIDIA GPUs and Jetson platforms.

## Topics Covered

In this chapter, you will learn about:
- Visual SLAM concepts and their implementation
- Hardware-accelerated perception pipelines
- Localization and mapping in complex environments
- Integration between Isaac ROS and ROS 2 systems

## Building on Previous Knowledge

This chapter builds on the perception concepts from Chapter 1, showing how sensed data is transformed into spatial understanding that enables navigation.
