# Introduction to ROS 2 for Humanoid Robotics

Welcome to the educational module on **ROS 2 Nervous System for Humanoid Robots**! This comprehensive guide is designed for AI students and developers entering the field of humanoid robotics.

## About This Module

This module covers ROS 2 as the middleware nervous system for humanoid robots, focusing on core communication concepts and humanoid robot description. You'll learn how ROS 2 enables complex robotic systems to function as an integrated whole, much like a nervous system in biological organisms.

## What You'll Learn

Through this module, you'll explore three essential areas:

1. **Introduction to ROS 2 for Physical AI**  
   Understand what ROS 2 is, why it matters for humanoid robots, and fundamental DDS concepts.

2. **ROS 2 Communication Model**  
   Master nodes, topics, services, and basic rclpy-based agent ↔ controller flow.

3. **Robot Structure with URDF**  
   Learn how to represent humanoid robot structure using URDF and ensure simulation readiness.

## Target Audience

This module is designed for:
- AI students entering humanoid robotics
- Developers working with robotic systems
- Anyone interested in understanding ROS 2 concepts for complex robotic applications

## Getting Started

Begin with **Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)** to build a solid foundation, then progress through the subsequent chapters at your own pace. Each chapter includes hands-on exercises to reinforce your learning.

All content in this module is sourced from official ROS 2 documentation to ensure technical accuracy and best practices.
